<img src="/public/img/Portrait-Fredy.jpg" alt="" title="Fredy Neeser" width="150" height="186" />Welcome to Fredy Neeser's weblog on networking and more!

In my blog, I will address various issues and findings regarding open-source and networking technologies, including network virtualization, SDN and OpenStack.

I decided to start my own technical blog to facilitate interactions with open-source communities.

### Personal Information
I live with my family near Zurich, Switzerland. In my free time, I enjoy outdoor activities including jogging, hiking and skiing. Also, I'm passionate about music and love to accompany our local gospel choir "mim chor & band" with my Warwick bass guitar.


### Professional Information
I am working as a Research Staff Member at the IBM Zurich Research Lab.

My professional life started in digital signal processing and coding. I received my Ph.D. in electrical engineering from ETH Zurich in 1993.  After joining IBM in 1994, I designed digital signal processing algorithms for the V.34 (33.6 kbps) and V.90 (56 kbps) voiceband modems in ThinkPad notebooks. I received two IBM Outstanding Technical Achievement Awards for my work on modems.  In my next project, I contributed to the design of a VLIW DSP by developing features for channel coding and filtering, and by creating a cycle-accurate DSP simulator.

In 2003, my interests shifted towards high-speed interconnects and datacenter networking. I contributed to Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) APIs and Soft-RDMA/iWARP, a Linux TCP kernel-sockets based software implementation of IETF's iWARP RDMA stack, which achieved single-connection-single-core throughputs better than 6 Gb/s.

Since 2010, I worked on the design, modeling and optimization of a chipset for a 100 Gb/s Converged Enhanced Ethernet (CEE) fabric, including flow and congestion control. The chipset included a hub chip with a transport layer that enables high-performance packet-by-packet multipath while maintaining in-order frame transfers for TCP. This work involved the modeling and optimization of an edge-to-edge (ETE) flow control protocol.

For low latency forwarding, I optimized speculative transmission techniques by ensuring robustness through automatic transitions between speculation and buffer reservation. To ensure a faithful hardware representation, I created detailed C++ models on top of the Omnest++ network simulation framework, including modules for CEE, the transport layer and an interconnection network with integrated switching. This enabled an accurate performance prediction during the design of the chipset. I co-authored several papers associated with this work.

In 2014, my professional activities shifted back towards open-source networking; my current interests include the performance of scalable and/or lossless fabrics, overlays, network virtualization, and offloading technologies such as RDMA.
